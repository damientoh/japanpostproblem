Japan Post ships to Singapore with a max weight of 30kg, with the marginal cost of shipping decreasing as weight gets closer to 30kg. If you have many parcels, where the sum of all parcels is more than 30kg, this algorithm will help you select the max subset of parcels to ship, such that the sum is less than 30kg, but as close to 30kg.
